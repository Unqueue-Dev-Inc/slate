# Introduction

## Overview

Welcome to the Unqueue API! You can use our API to access Unqueue API endpoints, which can get information on various orders, companies, and more.

We have language bindings in JavaScript! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples (if available) with the tabs in the top right.

## Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```javascript
const kittn = require("kittn");

let api = kittn.authorize("meowmeowmeow");
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

## Requests

The base URL for all requests to the Unqueue API is:
`https://us-central1-unqueue-staging.cloudfunctions.net/`
